### Features beyond assignment
- kmt_teardown, kmt_wait
- fork and execve in shell
- shell grammars like <>|""''
- color support(tty_set_color, tty_set_color, ls)

### To be handled
- memory recovery of pipe
I don't have a good idea of this(see kernel/src/pipe.c)
- run on one task continuously
My disign can't run on one task continuously, it needs to switch to idle task first(see kernel/src/kmt.c:kmt_context_switch)
